#Install devtools




#Install slidify: this step is tricky because the course did not give a correct answer. By googling I found 

https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify/issues/262


pkgs <- c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts")
devtools::install_github(pkgs, "ramnathv", ref = "dev")

Otherwise the libraries are not installed and will give error information and could not slidify Rmd file to html file.

library(knitr)
slidify('index.Rmd')
#browse the html generated from slidify(). 
browseURL('index.html')

#Another thing is: must set up chrome as the default program (go to control panel --> default program). IE does not work for browsing html file.

#Use "knit HTML" to generate html and slidify directly.
