#Install devtools




#Install slidify: this step is tricky because the course did not give a correct answer. By googling I found 

https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify/issues/262


pkgs <- c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts")
devtools::install_github(pkgs, "ramnathv", ref = "dev")

Otherwise the libraries are not installed and will give error information and could not slidify Rmd file to html file.

library(knitr)
slidify('index.Rmd')
#browse the html generated from slidify(). 
browseURL('index.html')

#Another thing is: must set up chrome as the default program (go to control panel --> default program). IE does not work for browsing html file.

#Use "knit HTML" to generate html and slidify directly.


#####Publish the slidified slides to Rpubs######

To publish on RPubs, I did the following:
slidify("index.Rmd")  #To make the .html
browseURL("index.html") #To verify that it's working
runDeck() #To re-verify it's worknig
options(rpubs.upload.method = "internal") #To set up what it needs to upload (ssl issue?)
publish_rpubs(title = 'my title goes here ', html_file = 'index.html')


# It is published at the following Address:
http://rpubs.com/lingyun/83524

shinyapps::deployApp("project1_v2")

#after deployment finishs a web page appears: https://developingdataproductproject1.shinyapps.io/project/

# The app status can be watched from https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard

#############However the document file cannot be shown in shinyapp.io

#### Do  I have to try shiny server ?

Temperarily I just deploy app on shinyapps.io. Not shiny server. It is too much.

#one problem that I encountered is that when I used "knitr html" to convert Rmd file to html file, the md file was not updated.

This problem is solved by using command line: knit('document.Rmd')
